--This gives us our list of the Blue Jackets opponents, home wins, total number of games and the percentage of games won at home by the Blue Jackets.
--Our top 5 opponents the Blue Jackets do best against at home are:
--Florida Panthers 66.67%
--New Jersey Devils 66.67%
--Philadelphia Flyers 65.22%
--New York Islanders 61.54%
--Minnesota Wild 61.30%

--So our best chance at seeing the Blue Jackets win at home would be on a Thursday against the Florida Panthers.
--Based on the upcoming 2023-2024 schedule, Thursdays being the best day at home on record, and the above listed 5 teams as
--the top 5 best opponents to face at home, we can determine that the best nights for a company outing to the Blue Jackets 
--where they would have the best historical chance at winning are the below dates.

--10/12/2023 against the Philadelphia Flyers
--04/04/2024 against the New York Islanders
